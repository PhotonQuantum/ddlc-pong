# DDLC pong cheater
A simple script to help you win Monika in the ping-pong game in Doki-Doki Literature Club using OpenCV.
As you know, you can hardly beat her in this game, so I wrote this script to automate the game play.
Btw, you may fail the game sometimes even you use this script.

**JUST MONIKA**

# Usage
Fill in the position of the game to the *mon* var, and you're good to go.

# Notice
I wrote this simple script several years ago, and I'm not going to maintain it anymore. You may complete/optimize it, if you wish.
